## Query Examples & Use Cases

### **GROWTH TEAM ANALYTICS - REAL BUSINESS QUESTIONS**

#### 1. Immediate Budget Reallocation Analysis

**Growth Team Question**: "Which campaigns should we shift budget to/from this week based on ROAS performance?"

```sql
-- Campaign Performance for Budget Decisions
SELECT 
    campaign_id,
    ROUND(SUM(cost_usd), 2) as total_spend,
    ROUND(SUM(revenue_usd), 2) as total_revenue,
    ROUND((SUM(revenue_usd) / NULLIF(SUM(cost_usd), 0)) * 100, 1) as roas_percentage,
    COUNT(DISTINCT unified_user_id) as unique_users,
    ROUND(SUM(cost_usd) / COUNT(DISTINCT unified_user_id), 2) as cost_per_user,
    CASE 
        WHEN (SUM(revenue_usd) / NULLIF(SUM(cost_usd), 0)) >= 0.45 THEN 'INCREASE BUDGET +25%'
        WHEN (SUM(revenue_usd) / NULLIF(SUM(cost_usd), 0)) >= 0.35 THEN 'MAINTAIN BUDGET'
        WHEN (SUM(revenue_usd) / NULLIF(SUM(cost_usd), 0)) >= 0.25 THEN 'REDUCE BUDGET -50%'
        ELSE 'PAUSE CAMPAIGN'
    END as recommendation
FROM master_unified_events 
WHERE campaign_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY campaign_id
ORDER BY roas_percentage DESC;
```

**Expected Results**: CID_b29c9c (50.7% ROAS) → INCREASE, CID_8e6114 (22.0% ROAS) → PAUSE

#### 2. Customer Acquisition Cost Analysis

**Growth Team Question**: "What's our true cost per customer by campaign, and which campaigns have the most efficient acquisition?"

```sql
-- True CPA Analysis with Revenue Attribution
WITH campaign_customers AS (
    -- Get customers attributed to each campaign via user journey
    SELECT 
        first_campaign.campaign_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT stripe.unified_user_id) as customers,
        SUM(stripe.revenue_usd) as total_revenue
    FROM (
        -- First campaign each user was exposed to
        SELECT DISTINCT
            unified_user_id,
            FIRST_VALUE(campaign_id) OVER (
                PARTITION BY unified_user_id 
                ORDER BY event_timestamp_utc 
                ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
            ) as campaign_id
        FROM master_unified_events
        WHERE campaign_id IS NOT NULL
    ) first_campaign
    JOIN (
        SELECT unified_user_id, SUM(revenue_usd) as revenue_usd
        FROM master_unified_events 
        WHERE event_type = 'revenue_event'
        GROUP BY unified_user_id
    ) stripe ON first_campaign.unified_user_id = stripe.unified_user_id
    GROUP BY first_campaign.campaign_id
),
campaign_spend AS (
    SELECT 
        campaign_id,
        SUM(cost_usd) as total_spend
    FROM master_unified_events
    WHERE event_type = 'ad_performance'
    GROUP BY campaign_id
)
SELECT 
    cs.campaign_id,
    cc.customers,
    ROUND(cs.total_spend, 2) as total_spend,
    ROUND(cc.total_revenue, 2) as attributed_revenue,
    ROUND(cs.total_spend / NULLIF(cc.customers, 0), 2) as cost_per_customer,
    ROUND(cc.total_revenue / NULLIF(cc.customers, 0), 2) as revenue_per_customer,
    ROUND((cc.total_revenue / NULLIF(cs.total_spend, 0)) * 100, 1) as true_roas
FROM campaign_spend cs
LEFT JOIN campaign_customers cc ON cs.campaign_id = cc.campaign_id
ORDER BY cost_per_customer ASC;
```

**Business Context**: Identify which campaigns deliver customers at the lowest acquisition cost for scaling decisions.

#### 3. Conversion Funnel Leak Analysis

**Growth Team Question**: "Where exactly are we losing customers in our funnel, and what's the biggest opportunity?"

```sql
-- Detailed Funnel Analysis with Drop-off Points
WITH funnel_stages AS (
    SELECT 
        'Stage 1: Ad Exposure' as stage,
        1 as stage_order,
        COUNT(DISTINCT unified_user_id) as users,
        0 as drop_off_from_previous
    FROM master_unified_events
    WHERE event_type = 'ad_performance'
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 
        'Stage 2: Website Visit' as stage,
        2 as stage_order,
        COUNT(DISTINCT unified_user_id) as users,
        0 as drop_off_from_previous
    FROM master_unified_events
    WHERE event_type = 'web_session'
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 
        'Stage 3: Product Engagement' as stage,
        3 as stage_order,
        COUNT(DISTINCT unified_user_id) as users,
        0 as drop_off_from_previous
    FROM master_unified_events
    WHERE event_type = 'product_event'
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 
        'Stage 4: Lead Generation' as stage,
        4 as stage_order,
        COUNT(DISTINCT unified_user_id) as users,
        0 as drop_off_from_previous
    FROM master_unified_events
    WHERE event_type = 'lead_event'
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 
        'Stage 5: Purchase' as stage,
        5 as stage_order,
        COUNT(DISTINCT unified_user_id) as users,
        0 as drop_off_from_previous
    FROM master_unified_events
    WHERE event_type = 'revenue_event'
)
SELECT 
    stage,
    users,
    LAG(users) OVER (ORDER BY stage_order) as previous_stage_users,
    ROUND(((users::float / LAG(users) OVER (ORDER BY stage_order)) * 100), 1) as conversion_rate,
    (LAG(users) OVER (ORDER BY stage_order) - users) as users_lost,
    ROUND((((LAG(users) OVER (ORDER BY stage_order) - users)::float / 
            LAG(users) OVER (ORDER BY stage_order)) * 100), 1) as drop_off_rate
FROM funnel_stages
ORDER BY stage_order;
```

**Expected Insights**: Identify whether the biggest drop-off is at web conversion, lead generation, or purchase stages.

#### 4. Product-Market Fit Analysis

**Growth Team Question**: "Which product categories resonate most with customers, and where should we focus product development?"

```sql
-- Product Performance Analysis by Campaign Category
WITH campaign_categorization AS (
    SELECT 
        campaign_id,
        CASE 
            WHEN campaign_id IN ('CID_4d2022', 'CID_c3462c', 'CID_eb0e7b', 'CID_24d427') 
                THEN 'Professional Surveillance'
            WHEN campaign_id IN ('CID_b29c9c', 'CID_41e0cd', 'CID_bd0155', 'CID_ebd8e0') 
                THEN 'Consumer Security'
            WHEN campaign_id IN ('CID_289879', 'CID_f428a9') 
                THEN 'Audio Equipment'
            WHEN campaign_id IN ('CID_b81460', 'CID_d474c7', 'CID_767d1e') 
                THEN 'GPS & Tracking'
            WHEN campaign_id IN ('CID_c2ec47', 'CID_fdc8d6', 'CID_f4720a', 'CID_f6d0d3') 
                THEN 'Communication & Mobile'
            WHEN campaign_id IN ('CID_ad5394') 
                THEN 'Detection Equipment'
            ELSE 'Other/Promotional'
        END as product_category
    FROM (SELECT DISTINCT campaign_id FROM master_unified_events WHERE campaign_id IS NOT NULL) c
)
SELECT 
    cc.product_category,
    COUNT(DISTINCT me.unified_user_id) as total_users,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN me.event_type = 'product_event' THEN 1 END) as product_interactions,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN me.event_type = 'lead_event' THEN 1 END) as leads_generated,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN me.event_type = 'revenue_event' THEN 1 END) as purchases,
    ROUND(SUM(me.cost_usd), 2) as total_ad_spend,
    ROUND(SUM(me.revenue_usd), 2) as total_revenue,
    ROUND((SUM(me.revenue_usd) / NULLIF(SUM(me.cost_usd), 0)) * 100, 1) as category_roas,
    ROUND(AVG(me.revenue_usd), 2) as avg_order_value,
    ROUND((COUNT(CASE WHEN me.event_type = 'revenue_event' THEN 1 END)::float / 
           COUNT(DISTINCT me.unified_user_id)) * 100, 2) as conversion_rate
FROM campaign_categorization cc
JOIN master_unified_events me ON cc.campaign_id = me.campaign_id
GROUP BY cc.product_category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

**Growth Strategy Context**: Use this to guide product development, inventory planning, and marketing budget allocation across categories.

#### 5. Real-Time Performance Monitoring

**Growth Team Question**: "How is performance trending week-over-week, and which campaigns need immediate attention?"

```sql
-- Weekly Performance Trend Analysis
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('week', event_timestamp_utc) as week_start,
    campaign_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT unified_user_id) as weekly_users,
    SUM(cost_usd) as weekly_spend,
    SUM(revenue_usd) as weekly_revenue,
    ROUND((SUM(revenue_usd) / NULLIF(SUM(cost_usd), 0)) * 100, 1) as weekly_roas,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'revenue_event' THEN 1 END) as weekly_purchases,
    
    -- Week-over-week change
    LAG(SUM(revenue_usd)) OVER (PARTITION BY campaign_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('week', event_timestamp_utc)) as prev_week_revenue,
    ROUND(((SUM(revenue_usd) - LAG(SUM(revenue_usd)) OVER (PARTITION BY campaign_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('week', event_timestamp_utc))) 
           / NULLIF(LAG(SUM(revenue_usd)) OVER (PARTITION BY campaign_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('week', event_timestamp_utc)), 0)) * 100, 1) as revenue_wow_change
    
FROM master_unified_events
WHERE campaign_id IS NOT NULL
    AND event_timestamp_utc >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '4 weeks'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('week', event_timestamp_utc), campaign_id
ORDER BY week_start DESC, weekly_roas DESC;
```

**Operational Context**: Monitor for sudden performance changes requiring immediate campaign adjustments.
