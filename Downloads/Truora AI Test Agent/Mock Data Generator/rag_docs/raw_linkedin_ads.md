# RAG Document: `raw_linkedin_ads.csv`

## 1. Source Description & Gist

- **File Name**: `raw_linkedin_ads.csv`
- **Data Source**: Simulates daily advertising performance from **LinkedIn Ads**.
- **High-Level Purpose**: This file provides daily spend and performance metrics for professional, B2B-focused campaigns run on LinkedIn. It is a key source for understanding ad effectiveness in a corporate context.
- **Agent's Primary Goal**: To ingest this data, with a primary focus on correctly parsing its unique, timezone-aware timestamp format and unifying it with the other ad platform sources.

## 2. File Structure & Schema

### Clean Data Profile

In "clean" mode, the file adheres to the standard ad platform schema.

- **Location**: `data/raw_linkedin_ads.csv`
- **Schema**:
    - `event_date`: `DATE` (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
    - `campaign_id`: `TEXT`
    - `cost_usd`: `DECIMAL`
    - `impressions`: `INTEGER`
    - `clicks`: `INTEGER`
- **Generation Logic**: The file contains **1,800 rows**, generated by the standard `build_ads()` function.

### Realistic Data Profile (with Entropy)

The `add_entropy.py` script applies one specific, important transformation to this file.

- **Key Transformation**:
    1.  **Date Format Change to Timezone-Aware Timestamp**: The `date` column is converted from a simple date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) into a full, timezone-aware ISO 8601 timestamp string. A random time is added to each date, and a fixed timezone (`-05:00`, corresponding to US Eastern Time) is appended.

- **Resulting Realistic Schema**:
    - `date`: `TEXT`, Contains timestamps in `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS-05:00` format.
    - `campaign_id`: `TEXT`
    - `cost_usd`: `DECIMAL`
    - `impressions`: `INTEGER`
    - `clicks`: `INTEGER`

- **Example of Realistic Data**:

  | date                        | campaign_id | cost_usd | impressions | clicks |
  |-----------------------------|-------------|----------|-------------|--------|
  | 2025-05-20T14:23:15-05:00   | CID_f9e8d7  | 85.34    | 3463        | 108    |
  | 2025-05-21T08:11:52-05:00   | CID_a1b2c3  | 93.75    | 2541        | 75     |

## 3. Key Challenges & Instructions for AI Agent

1.  **Date/Time Parsing**: The agent's primary task for this file is to correctly handle the timestamp format.
    - It must parse the full `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS-05:00` string.
    - For unification with other ad platform data, the agent should **truncate** the timestamp to just the date part (`YYYY-MM-DD`). The time and timezone information should be discarded to align with the daily aggregation level of the other sources.
2.  **Column Name Standardization**: Although minor, the agent should ensure the `date` column is renamed to the standard `event_date` for consistency.
    - `date` â†’ `event_date`
3.  **No Other Entropy**: This file has no currency issues, no major column name changes (other than `date`), and no missing data challenges. The focus is exclusively on date/time normalization.
4.  **Final Schema**: After parsing the date and renaming the column, the data will conform to the standard ad platform schema (`event_date`, `campaign_id`, `cost_usd`, `impressions`, `clicks`) and will be ready for unification.
